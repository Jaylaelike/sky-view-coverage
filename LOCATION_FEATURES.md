  - English: Standard compass directions
  - Thai: Localized directional terms
- **Detailed Format**: Shows both direction name and exact bearing (e.g., "NE (45¬∞)")
- **Visual Direction**: Compass icons in the UI for easy identification

### 4. üèÜ Nearest Station Recommendation
- **Smart Ranking**: Multi-factor accessibility scoring system
- **Accessibility Score** (0-100 scale):
  - Distance penalty: Closer stations score higher
  - Station type bonus: Technical stations get priority
  - Height/Power bonuses: Better coverage characteristics
- **Comprehensive Results**: Shows top 5 nearest stations with full details
- **Station Categories**:
  - Technical Stations: Actual broadcast towers with detailed specs
  - Coverage Areas: General coverage zones
- **Quick Navigation**: One-click fly-to functionality for each station

### 5. üñ±Ô∏è Click Event Handler - Current Location Button
- **Geolocation Integration**: HTML5 Geolocation API with high accuracy
- **Permission Handling**: Graceful handling of location permission requests
- **Error Management**: Comprehensive error handling for various scenarios:
  - Permission denied

- **Accessibility Scores**: Visual indicators of station accessibility
- **Station Type Icons**: Radio towers for technical, buildings for coverage
- **Distance Formatting**: Intelligent unit selection and precision

## Technical Implementation

### Geographic Calculations (`lib/geo-utils.ts`)
```typescript
// Core calculation functions
calculateDistance(point1, point2) // Haversine formula
calculateBearing(point1, point2)  // Compass bearing
findNearestStations(userLocation, stations, technicalData, limit)
calculateAccessibilityScore(station, distance)
getCompassDirection(bearing) // With Thai translation
```

### Map Integration (`components/leaflet-map.tsx`)
- **State Management**: Comprehensive state for all location features
- **Event Handling**: User interaction and geolocation events
- **Visual Rendering**: Leaflet integration for map overlays
- **Responsive Controls**: Mobile-optimized button layout

### Analysis Component (`components/location-analysis.tsx`)
- **Data Presentation**: Structured display of analysis results
- **User Interactions**: Station selection and navigation
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly interface

## User Experience Flow

1. **Location Request**: User clicks "‡∏ï‡∏≥‡πÅ‡∏´‡∏ô‡πà‡∏á‡∏õ‡∏±‡∏à‡∏à‡∏∏‡∏ö‡∏±‡∏ô" (Current Location) button
2. **Permission Prompt**: Browser requests location access
3. **Location Acquisition**: High-accuracy position obtained
4. **Map Animation**: Smooth fly-to animation to user location
5. **Visual Marker**: Enhanced user location marker appears
6. **Automatic Analysis**: Location analysis panel opens automatically
7. **Station Discovery**: Nearest stations calculated and displayed
8. **Interactive Exploration**: User can toggle line-of-sight, navigate to stations
